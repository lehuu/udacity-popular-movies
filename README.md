# Popular Movies

This project was created as part of the Udacity Android nanodegree term 1.
Using the Movie DB API we can browse through a list of popular movies.

## Getting Started

To run this project you need an Movie DB API-Key.
Get it here:

```
https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api
```

Next you need to add it to your global gradle properties.
You should find it here (create a gradle.properties if it doesn't exist yet):

```
Windows: C:\Users\<Your Username>\.gradle
Mac: /Users/<Your Username>/.gradle
Linux: /home/<Your Username>/.gradle
```

Here add the key with value MOVIE_DB_KEY e.g.
